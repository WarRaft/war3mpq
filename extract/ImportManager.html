	<p class="large_header_blue">The Import Manager</p>
	
	<p class="normal_white">
	Just as you can use the Object Manager to manage the connections linking all 
    the objects in the game, you can use the Import Manager to manage the files 
    that can now be imported into the game.<br>
    <br>
    The Import Manager keeps track of the imported file's name, type, size, and the path. 
    Once the map is saved, files in the Import Manager are packed into a single 
    file with the map, making the sharing of the map much easier.<br>
