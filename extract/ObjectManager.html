	<p class="large_header_blue">The Object Manager</p>
	
	<p class="normal_white">
	Because there are so many objects and ways in which they can be linked in this powerful new editor, there must be an efficient and easy way of managing them; hence, the need for the Object Manager.<br>
	<br>
	The Object Manager is at heart a summary of all the objects in your map. Yet, it is also a neatly organized list of all these objects, and it allows you access to modify them and see where they are placed on your map. Not sure if you selected the right Peasant for your trigger? Simply select that unit by its variable name in the Object Manager, and you can see where it is placed on your map by selecting View Object from the Edit menu.<br>
	<br>
	If you double-click on an object's icon, or if you select the object and select Edit Object properties from the Edit menu, you will be able to access its unit properties dialog. This is especially useful when you are creating very large maps, or your own campaigns.<br>
	<br>
	The Object Manager also manages your triggers. If the object is referenced in a trigger, you can expand it in the tree to see every category of every trigger that references it. By double-clicking on a trigger in this list, you can open the 
    Trigger Editor to the associated trigger. <br>
	<br>
	By selecting a trigger and expanding it, you can also see every object and variable referenced in that trigger's code. 
    You can then cross-reference that object or variable and view everything 
    that references it.</p>
