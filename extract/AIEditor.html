	<p class="large_header_blue">The AI Editor<p class="normal_white">The AI 
    Editor is where you can create artificial intelligence that will command an 
    army's development and attack strategies.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
		
    <p class="normal_white">
	
	<a class="small_header_blue" name="General">General</a></p>
		
	<p class="normal_white_margined">
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Name</i> - Here you can name your AI.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Race</i> - Select which race you would like to 
    create an AI for. The custom race option allows the 
    integration of custom units, abilities and upgrades. Remember to import the 
    custom data.<br>
    <br>
	<i class="oblique_blue">Options</i></p>
		
	<p class="normal_white_margined">
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Set Player Name</i> - Enable this option to set 
    the in-game player 
    name to the entered AI name.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Melee </i> - Use a melee AI for standard melee games. Melee AIs tend to attack and defend more 
    closely with allied players.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Target Heroes</i> - With this option enabled, the 
    AI will place a higher priority on attacking Heroes during battle.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Repair Structures</i> - Enable this option to have 
    workers automatically repair structures when needed.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Heroes Flee</i> - With this option enabled, Heroes 
    will attempt to flee from battle if they are seriously injured or unable to 
    attack.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Units Flee</i> - With this option enabled, 
    non-Hero units will attempt to flee from battle if they are seriously 
    injured or unable to attack.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Groups Flee</i> - With this option enabled, 
    attacking groups will attempt to retreat from battle if they are losing or 
    at a disadvantage.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Have No Mercy</i> - With this option enabled, the 
    AI will watch for opportunities to attack when the enemy appears to be 
    weakened or at a disadvantage. This attack corresponds with the Enemy - 
    Major Assault attack priority.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Ignore Injured</i> - Enable this option to ignore 
    units with less than 50% life when assembling attack forces.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Remove Injured</i> -Enable this option to 
    periodically send injured units home (or to a fountain of life) to recover.
    <br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Take Items</i> - With this option enabled, Heroes 
    will attempt to pick up any useful items they encounter. <br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Slow Harvesting</i> - With this option enabled, 
    only 1 gold or wood will be harvested by workers instead of the normal 
    amount. This gives the AI a slight economic handicap. <br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Allow Home Changes</i> -This option allows the AI 
    to potentially choose a new location as a home base for gathering and 
    retreating forces. <br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Smart Artillery</i> - With this option enabled, 
    artillery units will attempt to come forward and mount a siege attack on an 
    enemy base when possible. <br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow"><br>
    </i>
	<i class="oblique_blue">Custom Data<br>
    <br>
    </i>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Import</i> - Import custom data exported from the 
    Object Editor to include in your AI. <br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Export</i> - Export custom data to examine someone 
    else's custom AI data in the Object Editor.<br>
	<i class="oblique_yellow">Clear</i> - Remove all custom data from your AI.<br>
    <br>
	<i class="oblique_blue">Conditions</i> - Conditions can be configured here 
    that are similar in form to the conditions in the Trigger Editor but are 
    specialized for and only used with the AI Editor. Conditions created here 
    can be used throughout the AI editor.</p>
		
	<p class="normal_white_margined">
	A helpful concept when creating AI conditions is that of the AI captain, of 
    which there are two types, attack and defense. The captains are invisible 
    units without collision that act as guides for the AI. The attack captain 
    stays at the base structure (Town Hall, Great Hall, etc.), waiting for the 
    attack wave to form. Once formed, the attack captain leads the attack wave 
    to the current attack priority and then returns to the base. The defense 
    captain stays in between the base and the first gold mine unless an attack 
    on the base occurs. The defense captain then leads defense forces to attack 
    the intruders.<br>

    build, research and upgrade orders are specified here. When a unit dies, it will
